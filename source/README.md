These static files are generated via the `ils-underground-docs` repo:

`https://github.com/ils-underground/ils-underground-docs`

Files here should not be modified directly, but instead should be generated via the Sphinx build process using the resources in the `ils-underground-docs` repo

* TODO: add more info on how to setup the github repo in the static documents folder:
( `./ils-underground-docs/build/html/` ) so that generated files may be more easily pushed back here.
