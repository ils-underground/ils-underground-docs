How To Contribute
=================

This site is build with Sphinx ( https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html ) and ReStructured Text

You can contribute in several ways!

* Ask! If you post a message asking for something to be added / changed / removed, just post a message in the Sierra ILS Slack, and someone will help!
* Do it yourself! (TODO: add a page outlining how the workflow would go for making changes to these docs and how to then publish them)

TODO: 

* link to repo containing the build files for the docs
* how to clone / sync the repo down to your local machine
* how to edit pages
* how to build the static html
* how to push the changes back to the repo
* general guides to how we think this site should be structured, working with sphinx, how to work with .rst files, etc.
