ils-underground 
===============

This site aims to provide a place to post help, examples (code samples, scripts), short presentations, etc--related to the topic of working with the ILS on a technical-level

(something here about how to reach out to people involved with any of this--maybe a way to connect the the slack channel, idk?)

This resource is, "use at your own risk". If you feel something is wrong, or lacking please feel free to contribute--more info is available below on how to do so!
